## Video Object Segmentation and Tracking: A Survey

### VOS

bottom-up:

- spatio-temporal motion
- appearance similarity 

iteratively optimize energy functions / fine-tunes deep network

read multiple frames at once -> take full advantage of the  context of multiple frames -> suited short-term images



### VOT

use class-specific detector to robustly predict the motion state (location, size, orientation) -> suited long-term sequences

- generative / discriminative appearance models

- part-based tracking
- segmentation-based tracking
